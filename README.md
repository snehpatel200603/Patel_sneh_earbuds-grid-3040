# Earbuds Promotional Website
Welcome to the Earbuds Promotional Website project! This website was built using HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript, with the added touch of interactive animations using the GSAP library. This Read Me file provides you with essential information to get started with the project.

## Project Overview
This website is designed to showcase and promote a set of 3D earbuds. The site features a 3D model of the earbuds that users can interact with using GSAP for hover animations on the hotspots.
